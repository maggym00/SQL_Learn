This is just a set of notes that will be used - one for each session - to record commands etc.

SELECT
SELECT DISTINCT
ORDER BY
INSERT INTO
NULL
=============

SYNTAX ----------------------------------

SQL is NOT case sensitive => SELECT is equiv to select.

It is standard practice to put a ; at the end of each statement - some database systems don't strictly require it however it's useful as it allows you to input multiple statements into the same call to the server.


SELECT ----------------------------------

SELECT <column name> FROM <table name> ;

can specify multiple columns by putting , between column names, or specify all columns with the wildcard *

SELECT DISTINCT <column name> FROM  <table name> ;

DISTINCT specifies that you only want unique occurrences/combinations of values in the column/columns

COUNT(<column name>) --------------------

COUNT takes one argument and is used within SELECT - it returns the number of entries

ie. SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT <column name>) FROM <table name> ;

returns the number of non-identical entries to the specified column in the table 

WHERE -----------------------------------

The WHERE clause is used to filter records - it is used to extract only the records which fulfil some specification

WHERE is used within select as follows:
SELECT <column names> FROM <table name> WHERE <condition to be met> ;

Eg.

SELECT Country FROM CustomerInfo WHERE CustomerName = 'Mike' ;

note the ' ' for the name - it's a string (a value) as opposed to a column name which may be treated as a variable

The operators in the filter conditions are as follows
=		equals
<>		doesn't equal
<		less than
>		greater than
<=		less than or equal
>=		greater than or equal
BETWEEN		between a certain range
LIKE		search for a pattern
IN		Specify multiple possible values for a column

AND/OR may also be used to specify multiple or alternate conditions

NOT may be used to specify that you desire the opposite of whatever the condition is

ORDER BY ---------------------------------

used to sort the results that are returned - will do so according to numerical or ascii value (This means that it's case sensitive)
Default is ascending order - can specify using ASC/DESC keywords

SELECT * From CustomerInfo ORDER BY City ASC ;

will return all columns from CustomerInfo, sorted by alphabetical order in city name.
You can specify multiple columns so that it orders initially by one and then within that ordering, orders by another.
For each individual column that you are ordering by, you may specify ASC or DESC

INSERT INTO -------------------------------

Used to insert new data to a table
The format is

INSERT INTO <table name> (<column1>,<column2>,...) VALUES (<value1>, <value2>,...);

If data is being inserted for every column, there is no need to specify included columns however, just the values.

NULL --------------------------------------

Another option for WHERE conditions - if you want to find all entries where some column is empty,

SELECT * WHERE <column name> IS NULL

or alternatively - all the ones with useful entries

SELECT * WHERE <column name> IS NOT NULL
